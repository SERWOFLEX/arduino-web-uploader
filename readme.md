Try it now without having to install anything at [https://dbuezas.github.io/arduino-web-uploader/](https://dbuezas.github.io/arduino-web-uploader/)

Currently supports

- lgt328p (see https://github.com/dbuezas/lgt8fx)
- uno
- nano
- nano with old bootloader (most chinese clones)
- pro mini

## Activating Web Serial API

Until the Web Serial API is released officially, you have to options to enable it:

- As a user: enable Experimental Web Platform Features in your browser chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features
- As the owner of the webpage, you can get an API token from google (takes 5 minutes) so your users don't need to fiddle with flags. Learn more at https://web.dev/serial/#use

## Import directly into HTML

Just add the following to the head of your HTML:

```html
<script src="https://github.com/dbuezas/arduino-web-uploader/releases/download/v1.0.0/arduino-web-uploader.js"></script>
```

And add some buttons with their corresponding attributes

```html
<button arduino-uploader hex-href="[path to your hex file]" board="[name of the board]" verify [optional]>
  Upload blinker to lgt8f328p and verify uploaded code
  <span class="upload-progress"></span>
</button>
```

for example:

```html
<button arduino-uploader hex-href="./blinker.nano.hex" board="pro-mini">
  Upload blinker to pro-mini and don't verify (faster)
  <span class="upload-progress"></span>
</button>
```

see more examples in https://github.com/dbuezas/arduino-web-uploader/blob/main/test/index.html
try it now in [github pages comming soon]

## Generating hex files

<img src="./docs/export-hex.png" alt="Export the hex file" width="300"/>
<img src="./docs/open-folder.png" alt="Open the folder where it was stored" width="300"/>

use the hex WITHOUT the bootloader.

## Using as a node module

### installation

`npm install arduino-web-uploader`
or
`yarn add arduino-web-uploader`

usage:

```js
import { upload, boards } from 'arduino-web-uploader'
document.addEventListener('button', () => {
  const onProgress = (percentage) => {
    console.log(percentage)
  }
  const verify = false
  upload(boards.nanoOldBootloader, 'http://your-site.com/hex-file.hex', onProgress, verify)
})
```

## Structure

- `dist/`: typescript transpiled to javascript files for npm
- `src/index.ts`: uploader code
- `src/Serial.ts`: a wrapper of navigator.serial which also emulates a node stream for compatibility
- `src/test.ts`: a wrapper of the lib to use in HTML without writing javascript (for lazy people like https://github.com/seisfeld :D)
- `test/*`: some test html file. The file `src/test.ts` is also bundled there by webpack
